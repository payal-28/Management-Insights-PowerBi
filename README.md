# Management-Insights-PowerBi

This is a PowerBi project in which i have used a data containing information about "Customers", "Products" , "Regions" and "Sales".
Implemented DAX formulas to calculate new measures derived from information available in the dataset.
Created an interactive Dashboard which helps to interact between reports and visuals and identify trends and patterns.

Here's the screenshot of the Dashboard
